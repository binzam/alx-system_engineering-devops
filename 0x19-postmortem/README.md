Issue Summary:
Duration: February 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 16, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete service outage, resulting in unavailability for all users. Users were unable to access any features or perform any actions during this period.

Timeline:

Issue Detected: February 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: An automated monitoring system triggered an alert for high error rates and increased response time.
Actions Taken: The incident response team initiated an investigation into the potential causes of the issue. The primary focus was on the web server and database infrastructure.
Misleading Investigation: Initially, the team suspected a database failure as the root cause and spent several hours investigating the database cluster's health and connectivity issues.
Escalation: After exhausting the database investigation, the incident was escalated to the network operations team to investigate potential network-related issues.
Incident Resolution: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to reject incoming traffic. The misconfiguration was rectified, and the load balancer was restarted, restoring service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the service outage was determined to be a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. During routine maintenance activities, a configuration change was mistakenly introduced, causing the load balancer to reject incoming traffic. As a result, user requests were unable to reach the web servers, leading to the complete service unavailability.

To resolve the issue, the incident response team identified the misconfiguration and corrected it by reverting the load balancer settings to their previous state. Additionally, the load balancer was restarted to ensure all changes took effect. Once these actions were completed, the service was fully restored, and users regained access to the web application.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Configuration Management: Strengthen the change management process by conducting thorough reviews and testing before applying any configuration changes to critical components like load balancers.

Automated Testing: Enhance the automated testing suite to include load balancer configuration checks, ensuring that changes are validated before being applied in a production environment.

Monitoring and Alerting: Improve the monitoring system to provide real-time visibility into load balancer performance and configuration status. Set up alerts to promptly notify the incident response team of any anomalies or misconfigurations.

Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions for the incident response team to familiarize them with load balancer troubleshooting techniques and common misconfiguration patterns.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Perform a comprehensive audit of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Enhance documentation and standard operating procedures for load balancer configuration changes, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing and review.
Update the incident response plan to include specific steps for load balancer-related incidents and enable faster escalation to the appropriate teams.
Conduct a post-incident review with the incident response team to identify any gaps in knowledge or processes and implement appropriate improvements.
By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar service outages in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable web application for our users.
